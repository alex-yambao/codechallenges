"use a loop to find the sum of all numbers 1-100.
Create a simple function that implements your loop, and returns the answer.
Replace the starting and ending numbers (1 and 100) with parameters supplied with your function. So your function can find the sum between any integers, instead of only 1-100.
Bonus: create a simple webpage that uses a form to supply the starting and ending numbers, and display the result when the form is submitted."
